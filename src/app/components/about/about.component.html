            Passionate and driven cybersecurity enthusiast pursuing an M.Tech in Cyber Security at the National Institute of Technology, Kurukshetra. With approximately 2 years of professional experience as a Software Engineer at the Centre for Development of Telematics (C-DOT), I have honed my skills in full-stack development and gained hands-on expertise in designing and implementing robust systems.

My academic journey and professional experience converge at the intersection of technology and security, enabling me to explore cutting-edge solutions in network security, cryptographic protocols, and secure system design. I have a strong interest in network traffic analysis, quantum cryptography, and data protection strategies, complemented by my practical experience in simulating the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.

I thrive in dynamic environments that challenge me to innovate and grow. Whether building scalable applications or delving deep into cybersecurity research, I bring problem-solving skills, technical expertise, and a collaborative spirit to the table.</p>
